This repository will implement a shift register for the TI SN74HC595N 8 - Bit Shift Register
This file will work for PORTB of the AVR ATMEGA328P microcontroller. 
This function can be implemented to shift out the MSB first or the LSB first by setting LSB 

Ex/ void SR_out(int SRclk , int Rclk , int dataPin, int value , int LSB)
Set LSB to 1 for LSB first and LSB to 0 for MSB first. 
SRclk defines the clock signal to shift bits throught the shift register.
Rclk defines the pin to load bits into the buffer. 
the data pin is the serial data pin. 

All of these pins must utilize the PORTB pins for this function to work without modification. 


This repository uses "avr-gcc" as the compilier.
